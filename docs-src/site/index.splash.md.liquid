# What is Yass?

Yass is an astonishingly un-opinionated static site generator. Your sites's structure is entirely up to you: organize static assets, `.html` files, `.md` ([Markdown](https://commonmark.org/)) files, and `.liquid` ([Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)) templates however you want under `site/`. Liquid layouts and reusable templates are supported but optional.

The **one** opinion Yass holds is that **you** should decide everything. There's zero configuration and no conventions to learn!

## Getting started

{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install yass
$ yass init blog
Creating blog/layouts/default.html.liquid
Creating blog/site/assets/highlight.min.css
Creating blog/site/assets/highlight.min.js
Creating blog/site/index.html.liquid
Creating blog/templates/asset_tags.liquid
$ cd blog
{% endhighlight %}

The files that `yass init` creates are just a place to get started (starting from a blank page is hard). Modify, replace, or delete them at your whim.

* `site/` contains your site's source.
* `layouts/` contains [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) layouts (optional).
* `templates/` contains reusable [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates (optional).

## Building

Build your site into the `dist/` directory with `yass build`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ yass build
{% endhighlight %}

## Previewing

To preview your site on your computer, simply open `dist/index.html` with your browser ðŸ¤¯. (This requires using relative links, but there are helpers for that.)

If you're building for webserverless, local viewing, and using the `skip_index` filter anywhere, use the `--no-skip-index` option.

{% highlight bash %}
$ yass build --no-skip-index
{% endhighlight %}

The `watch` command will continuously build as you make changes in `site/`, `layouts/`, and `templates/`.

{% highlight bash %}
$ yass watch # --no-skip-index works here too
{% endhighlight %}
